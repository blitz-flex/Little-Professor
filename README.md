# Little Professor

### [Little Professor" by Texas Instruments](https://youtu.be/ZuJwzH9BIgs?si=vHdYxDB7JH-Ip2ly)
### As a child, David's one of the first toys was "Little Professor", a calculator that posed ten different math problems for David. If the toy displayed 4 + 0 =, David would write 4, and for 4 + 1 =, he would write 5. If David gave an incorrect answer, the toy would display "EEE". Finally, after three incorrect answers for the same calculation, the toy would simply show the correct answer (e.g., 4 + 0 = 4 or 4 + 1 = 5).
